#### Overview

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Information**: In this section, we will prepare the necessary AWS services to deploy the FCJ Management application using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing. This preparation ensures our application will be highly available, fault-tolerant, and capable of handling varying workloads efficiently.

The architecture we'll implement follows AWS best practices for scalable web applications:

**üí° Pro Tip**: This multi-tier architecture separates the web tier from the database tier, allowing each component to scale independently based on its specific resource requirements.

#### Workshop Modules

1. [Setup Network Infrastructure](2.1-setup-network/)
2. [Launch EC2 Instance](2.2-launch-ec2-instance/)
3. [Deploy Database with Amazon RDS](2.3-launch-db-instance/)
4. [Configure Database Data](2.4-add-data-to-db/)
5. [Deploy Web Server](2.5-deploy-web-server/)
6. [Prepare Metrics for Predictive Scaling](2.6-prepare-metrics-for-predictive-scaling/)

**üîí Security Note**: Throughout this workshop, we'll implement security best practices including proper network segmentation, secure access controls, and encrypted data transmission to protect our application and its data.
