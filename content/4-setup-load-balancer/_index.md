#### Introduction to Elastic Load Balancing

**ℹ️ Information**: Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets—such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses—in multiple Availability Zones. This improves your application's fault tolerance while ensuring seamless user experiences even during peak loads.

#### Key Benefits of Elastic Load Balancing

- High availability through intelligent traffic distribution across multiple Availability Zones
- Advanced security with integrated TLS termination, certificate management, and authentication
- Automatic scaling that adjusts capacity in response to fluctuating traffic patterns
- Seamless integration with AWS services including Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, AWS Certificate Manager, and Amazon VPC

**💡 Pro Tip**: Select the optimal load balancer for your workload requirements:
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS applications with advanced routing
- Network Load Balancer (NLB) for ultra-high performance TCP/UDP/TLS traffic
- Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) for transparent network security appliance deployment
- Classic Load Balancer for legacy applications running in the EC2-Classic network

**🔒 Security Note**: Enhance your security posture by combining Elastic Load Balancing with AWS WAF for protection against common web vulnerabilities and AWS Shield for comprehensive DDoS mitigation. For regulated workloads, ELB supports compliance with PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC standards.
